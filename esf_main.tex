\section{System Overview}\label{system_overview}
The vehicle's electrical system is designed to support all necessary functions of electric vehicle locomotion, while simultaneously ensuring driver and team member safety. The vehicle's electrical system is comprised of two major galvanically isolated subsystems: a 298.8V maximum high power tractive system and a 14V maximum sensing and control system.

The tractive system consists of a custom-designed and fabricated accumulator container which houses 72 LG Chem proprietary pouch cells, as well as a Rinehart Motion Systems PM100DX motor controller driving an Emrax 228 Medium Voltage outrunner motor. Communication to the motor controllers is achieved via the CAN network built into the low voltage system.

The low voltage system consists primarily of a shutdown circuit and a series of peripheral sensors to gather data about vehicle state and performance, all powered by a 12V nominal sealed lead acid battery that is recharged by a DC/DC converter. The Shutdown circuit monitors the vehicle for dangerous conditions such as impacts or isolation faults of the Tractive System, and de-energizes the vehicle in case of emergency. The low voltage system also contains a CAN communication network between Atmel ATmega16m1 microcontrollers that fulfill several rules-required functions like the Ready-to-Drive sound, as well as collecting data and serving as a debugging tool for both high and low power electrical systems.

See \fref{fig:TS_block_diagram} for a block diagram of the Tractive System and interfacing GLVS parts.

\subsection{Shutdown Circuit}\label{shutdown_circuit}

\subsubsection{Description/concept}
%Describe your concept of the shutdown circuit, the master switches, shut down buttons, brake over travel switch, etc.

The shutdown circuit directly controls the current that closes the AIRs. Since each switch/relay on the shutdown circuit is connected in series, that current must pass through every switch and safety check. If any device on the circuit is triggered by an unsafe condition, the current to the AIRs is cut off and the AIRs open, disconnecting the accumulator from the tractive system. Any capacitive load on the tractive system outside the accumulator is then discharged to ensure that all high voltage is contained inside the accumulator. 

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The GLV Master Switch (GLVMS) controls power to the entire low voltage system including the AIRs. As a result, high voltage cannot be present when the low voltage system is not active. The GLVMS has a lockout such that the vehicle can be safely worked on. 
		\item The Left E-Stop is a large red push-rotate button located at approximately the height of the driver's head on the left side of the vehicle. 
		\item The Right E-Stop is identical to the Left E-Stop located on the other side of the vehicle. 
		\item The Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) holds a normally open relay closed when it has not detected an implausibility. When it does detect an implausibility, it latches in a low state until the GLV system is power cycled. This shuts down the Tractive System in the event that the brake is pressed while the motors are being significantly driven.  
		\item The Brake Over Travel Switch (BOTS) is a push pull switch located behind the brake pedal. If the pedal over travels, the switch is pushed into an open state and stays that way until it is pulled back into the closed state. This shuts down the Tractive System in the event that brake pressure is lost. 
		\item The Dashboard E-stop functions the same as the other E-stops. It is located such that it can be easily pressed by the driver. 
		\item The Inertia Switch operates as a crash sensor that opens the shutdown circuit in the event that it detects an acceleration indicative of a collision. This ensures that the vehicle is electrically safe in an emergency situation. 
		\item The Battery Management System (BMS) monitors the condition of the accumulator. It holds a normally open relay closed while the lithium cells are operating within safe temperature and electrical conditions. 
		\item The Insulation Monitoring Device (IMD) detects any loss of isolation between the Tractive and GLV systems. It's output is held high while isolation is maintained. This holds a normally open relay closed through a latching circuit that prevents the IMD from re-closing the relay if the output goes low and then returns high. This latches the Tractive System in a shutdown state until the GLV system is power cycled. 
		\item The HVD interlock closes the shutdown circuit whenever the HVD is present. This automatically shuts down the Tractive System whenever the HVD is removed. 
		\item There is an interlock on the Tractive System connector on the accumulator which can be removed without tools. If the connector is removed, the Tractive System automatically shuts down. 
		\item The Tractive System Master Switch (TSMS) is the last switch in the shutdown circuit before the AIRs. It has a lockout such that the vehicle can be safely worked on. 
		\item Both the Pre-charge Relay and positive pole AIR have software controlled MOSFETs in series after them such that the timing of the pre-charge can be controlled by the sensing system.

\section{Overall Grounding Concept}\label{overall_grounding_concept}
\subsection{Description of the Grounding Concept}
%Describe how you intend to achieve the resistances between components at the required levels as defined in EV4.3.
The vehicle's steel chassis is uses as GLVS ground. This ground will be established inside the master switch panel enclosure by attachment to a piositively-retained ring terminal on a chassis member that has been locally stripped of paint. All components of the GLVS will be grounded to this point on the chassis through the wiring harness for simplicity of installation and mechanical robustness. All conductive mechanical enlosures are mounted to the chassis with conductive metal fasteners. Electrical connection of the suspension members and knuckles to the main vehicle frame will be achieved by short jumpers with ring terminals on either end in the suspension member bolt stackup on either side of the spherical bearing.


\subsection{Grounding Measurements}
%Describe which measurements you will take to ensure that EV4.3 is achieved
All conductive components within 100 mm of any Tractive System or GLVS component will be measured by Kelvin ohmmeter to have a resistance of less tham 300 m$\omega$ to chassis ground, measured at the chassis ground measurement point on the master switch panel. All fastened mechanical components and enclosures will be individually measured to ensure proper ground connection. Chassis ground continuity will be tested during and after assembly to ensure complete coverage. Any carbon fiber components will be exhaustively measured to ensure resistance compliance.
