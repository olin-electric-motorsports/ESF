\section{System Overview}\label{system_overview}
The vehicle's electrical system is designed to support all necessary functions of electric vehicle locomotion, while simultaneously ensuring driver and team member safety. The vehicle's electrical system is comprised of two major galvanically isolated subsystems: a 298.8V maximum high power tractive system and a 14V maximum sensing and control system.

The tractive system consists of a custom-designed and fabricated accumulator container which houses 72 LG Chem proprietary pouch cells, as well as a Rinehart Motion Systems PM100DX motor controller driving an Emrax 228 Medium Voltage outrunner motor. Communication to the motor controllers is achieved via the CAN network built into the low voltage system.

The low voltage system consists primarily of a shutdown circuit and a series of peripheral sensors to gather data about vehicle state and performance, all powered by a 12V nominal sealed lead acid battery that is recharged by a DC/DC converter. The Shutdown circuit monitors the vehicle for dangerous conditions such as impacts or isolation faults of the Tractive System, and de-energizes the vehicle in case of emergency. The low voltage system also contains a CAN communication network between Atmel ATmega16m1 microcontrollers that fulfill several rules-required functions like the Ready-to-Drive sound, as well as collecting data and serving as a debugging tool for both high and low power electrical systems.

See \fref{fig:TS_block_diagram} for a block diagram of the Tractive System and interfacing GLVS parts.

\subsection{Shutdown Circuit}\label{shutdown_circuit}

\subsubsection{Description/concept}
%Describe your concept of the shutdown circuit, the master switches, shut down buttons, brake over travel switch, etc.

The shutdown circuit directly controls the current that closes the AIRs. Since each switch/relay on the shutdown circuit is connected in series, that current must pass through every switch and safety check. If any device on the circuit is triggered by an unsafe condition, the current to the AIRs is cut off and the AIRs open, disconnecting the accumulator from the tractive system. Any capacitive load on the tractive system outside the accumulator is then discharged to ensure that all high voltage is contained inside the accumulator. 

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The GLV Master Switch (GLVMS) controls power to the entire low voltage system including the AIRs. As a result, high voltage cannot be present when the low voltage system is not active. The GLVMS has a lockout such that the vehicle can be safely worked on. 
		\item The Left E-Stop is a large red push-rotate button located at approximately the height of the driver's head on the left side of the vehicle. 
		\item The Right E-Stop is identical to the Left E-Stop located on the other side of the vehicle. 
		\item The Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) holds a normally open relay closed when it has not detected an implausibility. When it does detect an implausibility, it latches in a low state until the GLV system is power cycled. This shuts down the Tractive System in the event that the brake is pressed while the motors are being significantly driven.  
		\item The Brake Over Travel Switch (BOTS) is a push pull switch located behind the brake pedal. If the pedal over travels, the switch is pushed into an open state and stays that way until it is pulled back into the closed state. This shuts down the Tractive System in the event that brake pressure is lost. 
		\item The Dashboard E-stop functions the same as the other E-stops. It is located such that it can be easily pressed by the driver. 
		\item The Inertia Switch operates as a crash sensor that opens the shutdown circuit in the event that it detects an acceleration indicative of a collision. This ensures that the vehicle is electrically safe in an emergency situation. 
		\item The Battery Management System (BMS) monitors the condition of the accumulator. It holds a normally open relay closed while the lithium cells are operating within safe temperature and electrical conditions. 
		\item The Insulation Monitoring Device (IMD) detects any loss of isolation between the Tractive and GLV systems. It's output is held high while isolation is maintained. This holds a normally open relay closed through a latching circuit that prevents the IMD from re-closing the relay if the output goes low and then returns high. This latches the Tractive System in a shutdown state until the GLV system is power cycled. 
		\item The HVD interlock closes the shutdown circuit whenever the HVD is present. This automatically shuts down the Tractive System whenever the HVD is removed. 
		\item There is an interlock on the Tractive System connector on the accumulator which can be removed without tools. If the connector is removed, the Tractive System automatically shuts down. 
		\item The Tractive System Master Switch (TSMS) is the last switch in the shutdown circuit before the AIRs. It has a lockout such that the vehicle can be safely worked on. 
		\item Both the Pre-charge Relay and positive pole AIR have software controlled MOSFETs in series after them such that the timing of the pre-charge can be controlled by the sensing system.

\subsubsection{Description (type, operation parameters)}TODO
The IMD used will be a Bender A-ISOMETER IR155-3204. The output is normally high and only low if it does not detect a ground fault. The output is then sent to the IMD latch board, where it is powers a SPST-NO relay which closes a switch in the shutdown circuit. The output of the IMD is also monitored directly by an Atmega on the AIR control board. The status of the shutdown circuit is monitored by the MSP board. If the MSP board detects the relay is  open it activates the IMD light. The IMD has a strart up time of $\leq$ 2s. Further information on the IMD can be found in the appendix, section \ref{IMD_datasheet}.

The  IMD uses the TYCO-MICRO MATE-N-LOK 1 x 2-1445088-8 connector and it's mate. It connects to the accumulator interface board, which sends the signal to a through a 28 AWG ribbon cable to the IMD latch using a 6-pin TE Connectivity MICRO MATCH 338068-6 connector.The 28 AWG wire is used because the current draw of the IMD is 150mA, which allows high gauge wire to be used. The 28 AWG ribbon cable has a cross sectional area of .08mm$^2$, and is rated for 105 \textdegree C, 300 V, and 1.4 amps. There is a 1 amp fuse protecting the high voltage wiring of the IMD (details of the fuse are in the appendix, section ??). % I don't know the details of the fuse, but it is mentioned in both last year's ESF and in the ESF writing guide. It is visible in some of the plans for the electrical system. I need to know where I can find the details. Last year it was a 1 amp fuse, but it might be different this year. I am writing 1 amp for now, but it needs to be confirmed.



% I am not sure if this is actually how we are doing it, but I am assuming it is correct until I have time to check. I think it might be more convenient to route it through the AIR control board, if possible, as it already needs to connect to the Atmega on that board.

\end{figure}

The IMD latch shown in figure~\ref{fig:IMDLatch_Schematic} uses the signal from the IMD to close a relay in the shutdown circuit. In order for the shutdown relay to close a second relay needs to be closed. The second relay is initially powered by a one shot 4 second pulse from the GLV system. After the first four seconds the sicnal from the IMD is used to keep the secondary relay closed. If the IMD signal goes low the secondary relay will close. This opens the shutdown relay and makes it impossible for the IMD to close the shutdown relay again until the latch has been manually reset. The initial 4 second pulse is necessary to ensure that anomalous start up behavior from the IMD does not cause the secondary relay to open and force a manual reset.

\subsection{Brake Plausibility Device (BSPD)}\label{brake_plausibility_device}
\subsubsection{Description/additional circuitry}
%Describe how your electronic hardware brake plausibility system works (this is in addition to your ECU controlled brake plausibility software), provide tables with main operation parameters, and describe additional circuitry used to check or for an implausibility. Describe how the system reacts if an implausibility or error is detected.

The Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) is a custom circuit designed to open a relay in the shutdown circuit if the brakes are being pressed while there is positive-current being delivered to the motors for more than 0.5 seconds. The custom circuit takes in two digital signals, the brake signal and a boolean yes/no whether or not positive-current is being delivered to the motor. The positive-current will be sensed with our BMS using a hall-effect current sensor and a comparator which will output high when positive-current is being delivered to the motors. \\

There are two main sections to the circuit: the timing section and the latching section. The timing section consists of a 555-timer in monostable mode which is configured to be powered from the output of an AND-gate which takes in both the brake signal and the positive-current signal. This 555-timer will output a high pulse if the AND gate outputs a high voltage for more than 0.5 seconds. \\

The latching section of the circuit is a simple SR-latch, which will hold the relay open when tripped by the timing section. It will remain in this state until a reset signal is given, which will be from an ATmega. This reset signal will only be done when the GLV system is first powered on, thus making it non-driver resettable. \\

The schematic can be seen in \fref{fig:bspd_schematic}. \\

Resetting the IMD latch, which is shown in figure~\ref{fig:IMDLatch_Schematic} , requires restarting the GLV system. Restarting the GLV system will cause the IMD latch to send a pulse. If the output of the IMD is high because there is no ground fault, the pulse from the GLV activation will close the secondary relay, which allows the signal from the IMD to close the shutdown circuit.

\subsection{Ready-To-Drive-Sound (RTDS)}\label{ready_to_drive_sound}
\subsubsection{Description}
%Describe your concept of the RTDS, how is the sound produced, what are the parameters for activating the RTDS, etc.
The Ready to Drive sound is located as a component of the dashboard subsystem, and contains a buzzer (\href{http://www.mallory-sonalert.com/specifications/STA20502.PDF}{Link: Mallory Sonalert Products Inc. STA20502})\ref{Ready to Drive}. The buzzer automatically makes a noise when given power, with the loudness proportional
to the voltage. The BMS will notify the Dashboard CAN system when shutdown circuit is complete. This will then provide voltage to the gate of an N-FET which will provide a ground path for the buzzer.
\subsubsection{Wiring, cables, current calculations, connectors}
%Describe wiring, show schematics, describe connectors and cables and show useful data regarding the wiring.
When the shutdown circuit closes and activates the AIRs, the car is in ready to drive mode. As soon as the
car is in this mode, the CAN system will activate the ready to drive sound node to send a positive output
that provides voltage to the N-FET for 2 seconds, thus letting the buzzer sound for 2 seconds.

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{FormulasForDistanceAndSoundLevel}
	\caption{Inverse Square Law equations needed to calculate the volume at a certain distance}
\end{figure}
Using the inverse square law as referenced in the appendix  for sound pressure levels \ref{Ready to Drive}, 97db at 122cm will translate to 93db at 2m which is a loud enough volume without inducing harm to the listener. 
\subsubsection{Position in car}
%Provide CAD-renderings showing all relevant parts. Mark the parts in the rendering, if necessary.
The ready to drive sound will be located in the dashboard enclosure referenced in figure \ref{fig:Dashboard Render}. The buzzer will be mounted
to the exterior and front side of this enclosure. It must be contained outside of the box so that the buzzer is
loud enough. The speaker is waterproof, so it doesn't require any extra protection besides using an RTV silicone seal for final instillation.

\subsection{Description of the Grounding Concept}
%Describe how you intend to achieve the resistances between components at the required levels as defined in EV4.3.
The vehicle's steel chassis is uses as GLVS ground. This ground will be established inside the master switch panel enclosure by attachment to a piositively-retained ring terminal on a chassis member that has been locally stripped of paint. All components of the GLVS will be grounded to this point on the chassis through the wiring harness for simplicity of installation and mechanical robustness. All conductive mechanical enlosures are mounted to the chassis with conductive metal fasteners. Electrical connection of the suspension members and knuckles to the main vehicle frame will be achieved by short jumpers with ring terminals on either end in the suspension member bolt stackup on either side of the spherical bearing.


\subsection{Grounding Measurements}
%Describe which measurements you will take to ensure that EV4.3 is achieved
All conductive components within 100 mm of any Tractive System or GLVS component will be measured by Kelvin ohmmeter to have a resistance of less tham 300 m$\omega$ to chassis ground, measured at the chassis ground measurement point on the master switch panel. All fastened mechanical components and enclosures will be individually measured to ensure proper ground connection. Chassis ground continuity will be tested during and after assembly to ensure complete coverage. Any carbon fiber components will be exhaustively measured to ensure resistance compliance.
